        <h2 class="question" style="font-size: 18px;">I trust youðŸ˜…, and thatâ€™s why I feel my heart would be safer with you. In my eyes youâ€™re incredibly special in ways I canâ€™t describe. I donâ€™t know why, but I see only you, and I donâ€™t want to mess things up. I just want to be there for you until the time is right. At the same time, I want to give you the space you need to feel comfortable, and I want you to know that I have no intention of causing you any harm or holding you back academically. Please know that I understand
